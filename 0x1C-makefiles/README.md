A Makefile is a text file used in software development to automate the build process of a project. It contains a set of rules and dependencies that specify how to compile source code files and link them into executable programs or libraries. Makefiles typically consist of targets, prerequisites, and commands. Targets represent the output files or actions to be performed, prerequisites are the files or conditions that must be satisfied before executing the target, and commands are the shell commands to be executed to produce the target. By using Makefiles, developers can efficiently manage complex build processes, track dependencies between files, and ensure that only necessary components are recompiled when changes are made, thereby saving time and effort in software development workflows.
